# Blackjack_Game
In this project I add console printing functionallity to already exsisting code provided by Pierian Data note the code is property of Perian Data there repository can be found on this link https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp/blob/master/08-Milestone%20Project%20-%202/03-Milestone%20Project%202%20-%20Complete%20Walkthrough%20Solution.ipynb I do not claim to own this program this program is property of Perian Data.The added functionality to this exsisting code prints ascii cards onto the console for GAME IMMERSION. The ascii card template was found on this stackexchange code review forum https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/82103/ascii-fication-of-playing-cards. I do not claim to created the ascii card template or the actual Blackjack game, all I wanted was to combine exsisting code for my learning purposes.
